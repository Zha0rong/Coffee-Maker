Unfortunately, we are unable to recommend that you be admitted to our program.  A formal letter will follow from the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences.

We receive an extremely high volume of applications from a very talented pool of students and cannot admit all who apply.  In some instances we deny admission to those candidates who are good students, but whose academic training is still insufficient to successfully complete our rigorous Ph.D. program.

Students sometimes inquire about the specific reasons that they were not accepted.  Admission decision-making involves consideration of a wide range of information about a candidate, based on the dossier provided.  It is therefore our department policy not to discuss the specifics of any application decision.

I set up several phone interviews with one, who continuously had to cancel them last minute and then never got back to me in the end. I ultimately schedule a phone interview with the second professors, which was also postponed once, but I did finally speak to him and our interests matched well and he said he would like to organize a visit for me. After this phone call, I reached out to him a few times to schedule a visit but he never got back in touch. Then I received a rejection letter pretty late in the cycle (3/28), which I wasn't surprised by and I had already long given up on this school because the practices seemed very unprofessional. In any event, I accepted an offer from my top choice, so either way, I am happy for those of you who have found a home at this institution and I hope that they have been more accommodating for you than they were for me. :)"

I am writing to inform you of the decision regarding your application to pursue Ph.D. studies in the Department of Economics at Boston University. Unfortunately, we are unable to recommend that you be admitted to our program. A formal letter will follow from the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences.

We receive an extremely high volume of applications from a very talented pool of students and cannot admit all who apply. In some instances we deny admission to those candidates who are good students, but whose academic training is still insufficient to successfully complete our rigorous Ph.D. program.

Students sometimes inquire about the specific reasons that they were not accepted. Admission decision-making involves consideration of a wide range of information about a candidate, based on the dossier provided. It is therefore our department policy not to discuss the specifics of any application decision.

We appreciate your interest in the Department of Economics at Boston University and are sorry to report unwelcome news. Best wishes in your future plans.

Sincerely,"

It is also a rigorous academic program which requires high levels of analytic skills, especially in mathematics and statistics. Please be advised that your being admitted to the Master's program does not constitute any promise or implication that you will later be reconsidered for the Ph.D. program. Unfortunately Boston University does not offer any financial aid for master's students in economics, regardless of their merits, qualifications, or circu*stances. I hope you will be successful in securing funding to pursue graduate studies.""
