Dear XXXXXXX,

Earlier this morning, we mistakenly sent you an offer of admission to
Carnegie Mellon's MS in CS program.  This was an error on our part.
While we certainly appreciate your interest in our program, we regret
that we are unable to offer you admission this year.

We received a large number of applications this year from
well-qualified applicants and we had many difficult decisions to make.

Thanks you very much for your interest in Carnegie Mellon's MS in CS
program.  You are certainly free to reapply in the future, at which
time your application will again receive full consideration.

Again, we are sorry for our miscommunication earlier today and we
apologize for any confusion or inconvenience this has caused.

PS: Please acknowledge receipt of this retraction.

regret that I must inform you that your application could not be included among our
acceptances. To deny admission is an unhappy business, as much for those responsible
for the decision as for the candidate who is turned away.

The great majority of men and women who applied to the MHCI this year are clearly
capable of performing well academically and of making significant contributions to the
college community. The Board's task in selecting this years class has been extremely
difficult.

We want to acknowledge your accomplishments and we want you to understand how
much care we have taken in the admission process to get to know all of our applicants.
It was a very difficult decision to make. We wanted to make sure you heard from us
in a timely fashion, hence this email.

Although you may be disappointed by our decision, remember that in the long run
where you go to graduate school is far less important than what you do with the
opportunities that will come your way. Please know you have my best wishes for
success in your career plans.

With warm regards,
